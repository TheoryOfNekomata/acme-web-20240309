# `acme-web`

A demonstration for a simple React project

> Hello and welcome to this little project. It is a simple and short demonstration of React and Next and how you would
> use it to create Web apps. It is a CRUD app, which is a type of app that is popular with most projects.
> 
> I advise to fork the repository and play with the project. Observe the patterns in the implementation.
> If you found any bugs, then I give it to you, dear reader, to provide fixes. If you found it useful, or if it gave you
> insights, and want to talk about it, feel free to contact me using the links in my GitHub profile.
> 
> Thank you and happy coding!
